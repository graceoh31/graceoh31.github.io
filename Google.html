            <h5>Your school has built a new student center and is looking to you for some design expertise. Design the reservation experience for students, professors and community members to check availability and reserve one of the music rehearsal spaces within the new center.</h5>

            <h1><strong>Design Process</strong></h1>
            <br>
            <p>                <strong>1. Research:</strong> What is the current music rehearsal space reservation process at UCSD like? How do people interact with the space? What is the overall experience? <br>               
                <br>
                <strong>2. Gather insights, define problems:</strong> What are the users' goals and pain points? What are the underlying problems? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>4. Ideate and execute design solutions: </strong> How can we remove pain points and help users effectively accomplish their goal? How do other existing reservation systems operate, and what can we learn from them? Based on discovered problems and needs, how can we design to provide the best experience? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong> 5. Gather feedback, iterate:</strong> How can the design be improved? 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>6. Reflect: </strong>What did I learn? How can I improve as a designer? </p>

                <h1><strong>Research</strong></h1>
                <br>
                <p><strong>UC San Diego: Conrad Prebys Music Center</strong><br>
                    To get a better understanding of the current practice room reservation and usage experience, I spent several days researching, observing, and interviewing at UCSD's music facility. <br>
                    <p><strong>Online Research: OK google, how do I use the music practice 
                    rooms at UCSD? </strong><br>
                    Unfortunately, UCSD's Department of Music website does not have any information in regards to reserving and using practice rooms at the Conrad Prebys Music Center. I checked under 'Resources' as well as 'Facilities' but could not find any relevant information. The second result on google search? Several Reddit threads asking about music rooms at UCSD. <br><br>
                    <strong>Observations: How are the practice rooms structured? </strong>
                    <br>Thanks to the Reddit threads, I was able to find out where the practice rooms were located on campus. Currently, the practice room reservation is a first come first serve basis, with paper sign-ups for the week (Monday–Sunday) posted on each practice room door. There are also different types of practice rooms: General Practice rooms, Graduate pianist practice room, Indian Music Practice Room, etc. 
                </p>

                <img src = "./Google/signup" class = "img-fluid"> <br><br><br>

                <p><strong> Interviews: How do people feel about the space and reservation process? </strong><br>
                    I interviewed students from different backgrounds, teaching assistants, professors, and individuals waiting/looking for empty practice rooms to understand their expectations, views, and experiences with practice rooms. 

                    I wrote down important quotes, insights, and keywords. I then looked for common themes and patterns– connecting the dots.

                <div class = "text">
                    <h1><strong>Insights</strong></h1>
                    <p>By grouping common themes, I uncovered the following insights and summarized the main supporting evidence below: </p>
                </div>

                <div class = "text">
                    <p>There is a definite lack of clarity regarding room reservation policies and procedures (both online and at the present site), resulting in people disregarding the current registration system and resorting to assumptions ("I guess this is how it works around here"). <br><br>
                        Important questions were left unanswered: Where are the music rehearsal spaces located? When do they open and when do they close? What is the time limit? How many times am I allowed to reserve the space in a given time period? What amenities are in each room? What are the general rules I should follow? <br><br>
                        When the practice room space was especially busy, students lingered outside the rooms waiting for them to empty out. But, of course, they don't end up getting the room despite the time spent waiting. This is a result of people not using the paper sign-up system and instead following the first come first serve consensus, where people just use an empty room if they find one. <br><br>
                        Checking availability of the rooms is impossible without physically exploring the space. The requirement to sign-up in person every week to get a guaranteed spot is more of a hassle than it is efficient, because students don't end up following it, due to busy personal lives and schedules. Some students did not like the fact that they can only reserve a week in advance because it gives them less time to plan for future events and preferred to reserve a room a month or more in advance. <br><br>
                    I also learned that it is helpful for students to know generally how busy the rooms are (in the current system, students have to come in to check or predict based on patterns).  </p>

                                <p> “My two passions are computer science and cello performance, and I didn’t want to give either of them up in college, so I decided to double major. While I’m extremely grateful to be given the educational opportunity to explore both fields, it is tough balancing the two. My schedule is always packed and though I try to practice as much as possible for my music classes, it’s difficult to do because there’s no way for me to check whether practice rooms are available when I have to go in person to check– mind you, I play cello and it’s quite a big instrument to carry around. It’s also not only about whether a practice room is open, but which room is available for me to use. I absolutely need a music stand and a chair to practice, but some rooms in the music building don’t have either. So essentially to even look for available practice rooms I have to lug around my huge cello in hopes that there are available rooms– but that’s not always the case. I know I can come in early in the week to put my name on the sign-up sheet, but sometimes I don’t have the time to come in every single week to schedule rehearsal room reservations, which can be a hassle. For me, making the most out of my time is really important– I want to be able to access information, schedule way in advance, and practice as efficiently as possible. I don’t want to sacrifice my performance quality because I could not practice enough or effectively.”

I love my job because it’s extremely rewarding to see students make small improvements week by week. I schedule several listening sessions throughout the week. For these office hours I use the upright piano rooms, which are practical to help students with basic skills, such as achieving the correct pitch and rhythm. I oversee ensemble practices as well. It’s important for me to have access to bigger rooms with space and equipment for multiple people. Especially because scheduling sessions with students is in itself quite a big task, it is that much more frustrating when we cannot get access to the right rooms, despite the effort it took to set a date and time for us to meet. It’s definitely not easy scheduling sessions (especially with all the other responsibilities I have managing music courses), but I try my best to invest time and effort to make sure that students who are seeking improvement, mentorship, and critiques are receiving a quality learning experience.”

I’ve played the piano ever since I was young, and though I didn’t pursue a career in music, it has always been a hobby of mine. I like to learn and practice pieces on my own– it gives me a sense of mind and peace in the midst of my fast-paced, busy life. Right now, I'm not set on buying a piano, and I prefer not to get cheap piano keyboards because I want to produce more quality music when I do have time to practice (with a full time job, it’s definitely not easy to make time). I'm looking for a place to practice music nearby. I want to find available rooms with a grand piano and reserve in advance so that I can plan around my work schedule to practice.”

                                          <strong>Insights:</strong><br><br>
                                          One negative aspect was the inability to reserve practice rooms remotely or earlier beforehand. The current system is designed for reserving for the day through quick on-the-spot transaction– sign up and then practice right away (or in a couple of hours), which leaves no room for planning days, weeks, or months advance. 
                                          <br><br>
                                          However, there were many positive aspects as well. The screen displays both the types of rooms available and the available/unavailable times on one page so users can visualize the whole list of offered rehearsal rooms, weigh the different options, and choose a space. Before reserving a room, the system shows the reservation information (date/time/room/duration), which helps users recognize as opposed to recall their choices and serves as a great reminder before clicking 'Reserve.' After reserving a space, users can see the updated information at the top of the navigation, easily accessible and removable (in the case of cancellations or accidental reservations – ability to recover from errors). <br><br>
                                          I noticed that the user had to take a picture of the screen to take note of the room number, time, and access code. One way the system could exceed expectations (not just meet them) is to  send reservation confirmation via email or text as opposed to relying on the users to remember or write down reservation information. Later, this observation helped me make the decision to design for mobile, so that users can directly check, reserve, and access their reservation information on their phones. <p>

                                                <p>At first I tried to synthesize the use cases into one or two main navigations. I asked myself: Can I add general practice room information above the list of available rooms and times? Should general information (FAQ/Help/About) be a main navigation? Should users access filters as they choose a date to check available rooms and times? 
                                                    <br><br> 
                                                    I realized that combining different user goals into one or two navigations was not a smart idea because 1. the details may appear cramped, forced, and displaced and 2. it complicates as opposed to simplify tasks (user wants to see all available rooms and times on a specific date vs. user has preferences for a specific room/equipment but is flexible with date– two very different goals). <br><br>

                                                    I decided to create three main navigations <strong>(Availability, Filters, and Reservations)</strong> and a side navigation for general information <strong>(About).<strong></p>

I wanted to  design a way for users to check current traffic and see patterns. I  did so by displaying available time slots on any given day. <br><br>
                                                                    I created multiple iterations, testing designs that had green circles indicating many slots available, yellow indicating almost full, and red indicating full. However, based on feedback, users did not fully understand the correlation between the colors and its implications. <br><br>

                                                                    I simplified the design to have two main colors: green to indicate that most time slots are available (around 70% or more) and red to indicate that most time slots were unavailable (around 70%  or more). By noting only the extremes (not "kind of  full" or "average"), the design would prove more useful and meaningful. This feature would be useful for users to plan ahead, such as: <br><br>

This will allow users to compare different available rooms and weigh their options to make the best decision based on the type of room, equipment available, and available times. </p>

However, because I knew I had to organize and analyze the data and artifacts, I was worried I would not have enough time to brainstorm and execute quality designs. I was afraid of not finding the right solution, whether it be due to a lack of time or creativity, or both. However, the more I gathered and analyzed research, the clearer the problems became and subsequently, the faster and better the solutions came. <strong>I realized that the real problems and right solutions exist not in my own head, but outside of it– in the real world. </strong><br><br><br>

                                                                        <strong>2. Learn the pattern.</strong><br><br>
                                                                        One of the insights I gathered from research is that people had a general sense of when reservation rooms were most occupied or free (i.e. busy during finals week, not busy on weekends), and used that information to their advantage. One professor recalled that when he was music student decades ago, he would figure out when the best and worst times were to practice. This was a common behavior in current students as well. I understood the importance of noticing the way people think, especially in design. I noted this subtle tendency and designed a way for people to know the general traffic of the practice rooms and to reserve with the displayed information in mind. <strong>I learned to be attentive to patterns in human behavior and way of thinking. </strong><br><br><br>


                                                                        <strong>3. Do the right deed and design for the need. </strong><br><br>
                                                                        At first, I questioned whether designing an 'About' page was off-tangent to the main task of checking and reserving practice rooms. However, because I saw a widespread problem regarding the lack of information in the current reservation system, I knew it was something that needed to be addressed. Though it may appear unimportant, it provides essential information that can lead users to have a positive experience using the new system and physical space. <strong>I was reminded of how important it is to design for the real need, regardless of how small the solution may seem.  </strong>

                                                                 I'm grateful for the learning experience completing the design challenge and I was able to proceed to the next round.
